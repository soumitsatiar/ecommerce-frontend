## Digital Marketplace – Frontend

A modern React + Vite + Tailwind (v4) frontend starter. The homepage showcases a digital services marketplace with a hero, search, categories, and featured services.

### Tech

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite 7
- Tailwind CSS v4 (with CSS variables and color tokens)
- lucide-react icons

### Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the app at the printed local URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Notes

- Update the placeholder content, categories, and featured services data in `src/HomePage.tsx` as you integrate real APIs.
- UI components live in `src/components` and base button styles in `src/components/ui/button.tsx`.
